The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you attempt to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded.  This often happens when using asynchronous functions and not properly handling promises or callbacks. For example, if you try to access `snapshot.data().someField` within an asynchronous function without awaiting the promise or using `.then()`, the `snapshot.data()` might still be null or undefined, leading to a runtime error.
